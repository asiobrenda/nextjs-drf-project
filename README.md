# nextjs-drf-project
This is a simple task management web application built using Next.js for the frontend and Django REST Framework for the backend. It allows users to create, update, and delete tasks.  This is my first full-stack project using Next.js and DRF, created to practice building modern web applications with a React-based frontend and a Python backend API.
